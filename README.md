# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi there! I'm currently working as a **Customer Success Manager at CyberCare**, where I'm known for being highly motivated and driven. My role has significantly sharpened my **communication skills**, strengthened my **sense of responsibility**, and taught me the importance of **time management** and working within a **well-organized environment**.

Alongside my current job, I'm developing a deep interest in **data science**â€”with a focus on **data manipulation, preprocessing**, and **predictive modeling**. I'm passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights that can drive smarter decisions and real-world impact.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m gradually incorporating **sports and exercise** into my routine to help maintain a well-balanced lifestyle. Iâ€™m always excited to learn, grow, and take on new challenges that advance both my personal and professional development.
